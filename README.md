Methodology

Loading and preprocessing the dataset:

The code assumes that you have a dataset consisting of images and corresponding labels stored as dataset.npy and labels.npy, respectively. You can replace these file names with your actual dataset files.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection. By default, 80% of the data is used for training, and 20% is used for testing.
The images in the dataset are preprocessed using the preprocess_input function from tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2. This step ensures that the images are suitably preprocessed according to the requirements of the MobileNetV2 model.
Data augmentation:

The ImageDataGenerator from tf.keras.preprocessing.image is used to perform data augmentation on the training set. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zooming, shifting, shearing, and flipping are applied to create additional training samples. This helps in improving the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.
Building the model:

The MobileNetV2 model is loaded as the base model using tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.MobileNetV2. It is pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and has proven effective for various computer vision tasks.
The base model's output is connected to additional layers to form the head of the model. This head consists of an average pooling layer, a flatten layer, a dense layer with ReLU activation, a dropout layer for regularization, and a final dense layer with a sigmoid activation for binary classification (with or without a face mask).
The complete model is created using tf.keras.models.Model by specifying the inputs (base model's input) and outputs (head model's output).
Freezing the base layers:

The base layers of the MobileNetV2 model are frozen by setting layer.trainable = False for each layer in the baseModel.layers loop. This prevents the weights in the base layers from being updated during training, allowing the head layers to learn from the features extracted by the base layers.
Compiling and training the model:

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer using a learning rate of 1e-4 and binary cross-entropy loss.
The fit function is called to train the model. The training data is generated on the fly using the augmented images from datagen.flow. The validation data is specified as the original testing set. The number of training and validation steps per epoch is determined based on the batch size.
The model is trained for 20 epochs, but you can adjust this number based on your specific needs.
Evaluation and saving the model:

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set by generating predictions using model.predict. A classification report is then printed, showing metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
Finally, the trained model is saved as face_mask_detection_model.h5 for future use.
Remember to adjust the code according to your specific requirements, such as file paths, model architecture modifications, or training parameters.
